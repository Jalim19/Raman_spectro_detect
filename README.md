# Raman_spetro_detect
use a method--DTW to match two similar Raman spetros; some metrics and some preprocesses that dealed with origin data.

I sorry to give such a drift here, but I have no time make it clear. However, I still hope I can help you.

The codes are part of my graduate work. The data I have used in this experiment can't be shared, for they arenot open source.
